    But, with the increase in coronavirus claims worth thousands
    of crores and the <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank" title="go to google"> Insurance Regulatory and Development 
    authority of India (IRDAI) </a> standard rules, the companies 
    are forced to hike the prices.
    Most companies revise premiums at the beginning of the 
    new financial year. In such a situation, the companies 
   are allowed to revise the premium of health insurance 
   policy from April 1.

   There are also the ballistics - anything that affects the flight path of the bullet that could cause the sniper to miss.
   Extensive ballistics knowledge is one of several key differentiators between snipers - expert marksmen - and other troops who are simply good shots, according to a former instructor.
   "We know what a bullet does," John Wayne Walding, 
   a former US Army Green Beret who became a Special Forces
   sniper instructor after losing a leg in Afghanistan, told Insider. "A sniper has education on not just what the bullet's doing but why it's doing it. 
  That is what sets us apart."

  There are both internal and external ballistics, he said.
   Internal is everything happening inside the rifle and includes things like bullet size and weight, which affect to what degree a bullet will be impacted by the various external factors, and the barrel twist, which affects the 
   spin drift of the round at greater distances.External ballistics 
   are everything happening to the bullet once it
   exits the barrel. Among the external factors that 
   can affect the bullet's flight path are atmospherics 
   like wind, humidity, temperature, barometric 
   pressure, and air density.
   Wind speed and direction, which can change 
   suddenly and inexplicably, are particularly important
   because they account for most missed shots,
   US Marine Corps Scout Sniper instructor Staff 
   Sgt. Joshua Coulter told Insider.
   Snipers need to know wind at not only their position, 
   but also at various points along the bullet's path and at the 
   target. To get a wind reading for the distant points, 
   the sniper looks for makeshift wind indicators like trash, 
   clothes on a clothesline    </p >
